                    <h1>Akan Name</h1>
                    <p>The Akan people of Ghana frequently name their children 
                        after the day of the week they were born and the order 
                        in which they were born. These "day names" have further 
                        meanings concerning the soul and character of the person.
                        Middle names have considerably more variety and can refer 
                        to their birth order, twin status, or an ancestor's middle 
                        name.</p>

                        <p>This naming tradition is shared throughout West Africa and 
                        the African diaspora. During the 18thâ€“19th centuries, slaves 
                        in the Caribbean from the region that is modern-day Ghana were 
                        referred to as Coromantees. Many of the leaders of slave rebellions 
                        had "day names" including Cuffy or Kofi, Cudjoe or Kojo, and Quamina 
                        or Kwame/Kwamina.</p>
